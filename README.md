## Controlled vs Uncontrolled forms

#### Avoid TypeErrors by using Arrow functions

##### the 'this' keyword in an arrow fnct is automatically bound to the 'this' keyword

###### only during the time when the user calls the callBack do we know what the 'source of truth' is.

###### Uncontrolled form: info was stored in the HTML EX.. <input value="Hi there!" /> VS.

###### Controlled form: state -> { term: 'hi there' }

### \*\*\* UNCONTROLLED FORM stored in the DOM.

#### Flow

##### 1. User types in input

##### 2. Callback gets invoked

##### 3. We call setState with the new value

##### 4. Component re-renders

##### 5. Input is told what its value is (coming from state)

### refactor uncontrolled to controlled form

# 1. Need to get a search term from user

# 2. Need to use that search term to make a request to an outside API and fetch data

# 3. Need to take the fetched images and show them on the screen to a list

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
